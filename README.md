# snake-game

Inspired by: ***I Built A Snake Game By Reversing A Linked List, JavaScript & React project tutorial***. Follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Rkib_fvowE&ab_channel=Cl%C3%A9mentMihailescu) link to the video.

I will try creating a snake-game inspired by above video. Following the steps described in the video. Original video describes building the game in React. As I am a professionally a angular developer I'll do it in angular.

# Steps to be performed:

 -  Create board.
 - Create Snake
	 1. Represent using Singly Linked List
	 2. Handling snake growth.
	 3. Snake direction reversal*.
 - List item
 - Styles: Snake Cell & Food Cell.
 - Handling keypress.
 - Handling movements.
 - Handling Food Consumption with 2 types of food, generate any one randomly(poison & lifeline)*.
 - Handling death.
 - Handling scores.
 - List item
 - Handle game start/end.

**= will do after making a basic snake game.*
