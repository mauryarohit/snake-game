    c. Snake direction reversal*.<br />
 3. Styles: Snake Cell & Food Cell.<br />
 4. Handling keypress.<br />
 5. Handling movements.<br />
    a. Arrow keys to change direction.<br />
    b. Spacebar for starting/pausing* the game.<br />
 6. Handling Food Consumption.<br />
    a. Two types of food, generate both randomly*<br />
        i. Poison : Make snake shorter by 1 unit and reverse direction (cannot be generated when snake.length == 1)<br />
        ii. Life: Increment snake's length.<br />
 7. Handling death.
 8. Handling scores.
 9. Handle game start/end.
